*** A Dummy Wiring-Pi Library ***

I built this simple library of stubs, so I could compile my Raspberry Pi programs
on Ubuntu. The wiringPi methods just no-op stubs, and do nothing, but it does
allow the program to compile. Only the core library functions exist at the moment.

I might expand it in the future to actually simulate the real GPIO pin behaviour,
and have some UI that can toggle simulated switches and so on. But for now all
I need is this stub library. 8-)
